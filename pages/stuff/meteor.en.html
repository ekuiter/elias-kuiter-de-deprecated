Yet Another &quot;Why Meteor?&quot; Post

<h4>&quot;Build apps that are a delight to use, faster than you ever thought possible&quot;</h4>
<p>Pretty bold headline, isn't it?</p>

    This is the current slogan of the <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor Project</a>.
    Meteor is a radical new way for quickly developing great web sites based on JavaScript.
    (Involving Node.js, Cordova/PhoneGap and &quot;reactive&quot; programming that <em>just works</em>.)

    <p>
    I highly recommend you to <a href="http://meteor.com">check it out</a> (or rather <a href="http://discovermeteor.com">Discover</a> it), if you haven't yet.
    Especially if PHP gives you a headache (for <a href="http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">good reasons</a>)
    and Rails is too slow and bulky for your task.
    </p>
    <p>Here's my personal opinion on Meteor:</p>
    <p>
    <strong>It is <em>great</em>.</strong> I mean, seriously.
    Coding apps like <a href="http://todos.meteor.com">this</a> in a few hours, sometimes even minutes? Too good to be true.<br />
    Well, there are some drawbacks too. See it in my personal &quot;Meteor pros and cons&quot;.

    <h5>Mind-blowing</h5>
    <ul class="plain-list">
      <li>+ it's <strong>declarative</strong>. You tell Meteor <em>what you want</em>, and not how to <em>do</em> that (e.g. you tell Meteor there's
      a <em>Posts</em> collection and it wires up the whole CRUD business for you). This means you write <strong>less code</strong> in total</li>
      <li>+ it's <strong>reactive</strong>. This means that if some guy on the Canary Islands likes a post I created, this instantly shows
      up on my screen too <em>without me writing code for that at all!</em></li>
      <li>+ there's <strong>latency compensation</strong>. Sounds rather complex, but it just means that the user doesn't need to wait on the server's
      response every time an API call is made (goodbye to many <em>Loading ...</em> messages)</li>
      <li>+ it has great <strong>community</strong> and <strong>documentation</strong>. Just look at the 1-page <a href="http://docs.meteor.com">Docs</a>.
      As for the community, people are incredibly helpful and there are such great apps built with Meteor
      (go check out some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MeteorVideos">Lightning Talks</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h5>Not So Great</h5>
    <ul class="plain-list">
      <li>- your client needs to enable JavaScript (unless you do some fancy stuff like <a href="https://github.com/meteorhacks/meteor-ssr">Server Side Rendering</a>)</li>
      <li>- it's still tightly coupled to MongoDB. If you prefer other (e.g. SQL-esque) databases, you might run into issues</li>
      <li>- <a href="http://meteor.com">meteor.com</a> is fine for deployment at first, but not suitable for production
      (e.g. there's no oplog tailing which is vital to make your app fast) - <span style="color: darkred">objection: Galaxy is coming!</span></li>
      <li>- no Windows support - <span style="color: darkred">objection: coming too!!1!</span></li>
      <li>- I find <a href="http://atmospherejs.com">Atmosphere</a> (Meteor's package management server) to be a little confusing and crowded sometimes -
      how do I know which of the <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/?q=bootstrap">countless Bootstrap packages</a> to choose?
      (there are <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/twbs/bootstrap">official packages</a> but I don't think they are distinctive enough)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
Meteor is evolving at a rapid pace. This means some of the problems will be dealt with (mainly the Windows support).<br />
But this can also be challenging because you have to keep up with its development - for that I recommend you to subscribe to
<a href="http://crater.io/">crater.io</a>, a Reddit-like newspaper for Meteor developers
(speaking of which, there's a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/meteor">subreddit</a> too).
</p>
<p>
So, that's what I think - now there's only one thing left to say: <strong>Start coding with Meteor, you'll love it! :)</strong>
