	The do-it-yourself LED cube is a classic combining tricky construction and smart programming. Why is it that fascinating? Because there are plenty
	of possibilities: Starting with countdowns and tickers up to complex animations (like in this 
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mXM-oGggrM" target="_blank">awesome 8x8x8 cube demo</a>). But you can also build more interactive projects: 
	A 3D equalizer that visualizes volume with a microphone  or is connected to a MIDI keyboard; even games can be implemented - I'm thinking of 
	<a href="http://stewd.io/pong/" target="_blank">Pong</a> or <a href="http://neave.com/snake/" target="_blank">Snake</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	You have decided to build an LED cube? Great, then let's think about the size. For starters e.g. a 3x3x3 cube is suitable, that means the cube is 
	3 LEDs wide, high and deep, so you need 3*3*3 = 27 LEDs in total. Of course you can't compare the display 'quality' with an 8^3 or 16^3, but for 
	those you also need far more LEDs: An 8*8*8 = 512 or 16*16*16 = 4096 LED cube is not only really expensive but also requires enormous effort to solder.
	</p>
	<p>
	The cube size also plays a decisive role for cube control. The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardLeonardo" target="_blank">Arduino Leonardo</a>
	I'm using here has 14 digital + 6 analog = 20 pins. With a technique called Multiplexing (more on this later) a 4x4x4 cube can be controlled with 20 wires,
	so the Leonardo is perfectly suited. If you want more than 4^3 LEDs you run into problems because you need more than 20 pins - but the Uno/Leonardo has 
	only 20 pins. Now you have two basic choices: Use a bigger board like the 
	<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardMega" target="_blank">Arduino Mega</a> or pin-expanding methods like shift registers 
	(what makes the circuit diagram and soldering more complicated). I chose the 4x4x4 cube (64 LEDs) because it's relatively simple to build and control.
	</p>
	<p>
	Now go get the required components. You should think twice whether you buy diffused or clear LEDs. Clear LEDs gleam very intense on the top but only
	slightly on the sides, whereas diffused LEDs gleam equally to all directions (see picture). Especially for an LED cube I think diffused LEDs look much 
	better, but they are also more expensive. Alternatively you can buy clear LEDs and sand them with sand paper: The light then is 'trapped' in the LED 
	and the beam angle increases. I bought 70 clear LEDs and sanded them with 400G sand paper, but I can't really recommend it because it takes long, is
	laborious and requires much patience.
	</p>
	<p>
	Apart from that you need basically the normal material: Soldering equipment, (stranded) wire, shrink tubing, pin strip. For mounting the cube you can 
	use a perfboard with M4 screws and threaded spacers. For the circuit you also need 4 NPN transistors and 16 resistors. Here's a list of the components
	I bought from the German online shop <a href="http://reichelt.de/" target="_blank">Reichelt</a>, you can use these as a suggestion:

	The next part will be about constructing the actual LED cube with a little template I built.
