	The LED cube software provides three modes of operation: <strong>Loop mode</strong>, <strong>Clap mode</strong> and <strong>Visual mode</strong>.<br />
	The three videos on this site show you how these modes work.

		<h4>Loop mode</h4>
		<hr />
		<p>
		By default, Loop mode is active after turning on the LED cube.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this mode all effects are shown successively in a continuous loop
		in order that every effect is active for a few seconds.
		</p>
		<p class="small">
		Internally the effects are called:<br />
		<em>fill, scanner, randomize, extend_from_corner, snake, up_down, image, fan</em>
		</p>

	<div class="large-6 columns">
		<h4>Clap mode</h4>
		<hr />
		<p>
		You can activate Clap mode by pressing the mode button at the front of the LED cube once.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this mode an effect is shown until you clap or make loud noise - then the next effect is shown. 
		</p>
		<p class="small">
		That works as follows: The attached microphone detects the environment volume. If it exceeds a certain threshold (e.g. through clapping),
		an effect change is triggered. Therefore this mode doesn't work well in a loud environment.

	<div class="large-6 columns">
		<h4>Visual mode</h4>
		<hr />
		<p>
		If Clap mode is active, you can switch to Visual mode by pressing the mode button once.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this mode the LED cube displays the environment volume graphically - so it's also suited for non-MIDI devices like a piano.
		</p>
		<p class="small">
		See: <a href="#" onclick="alert('A simple USB MIDI visualizer with shift registers. Coming soon!')">MIDI visualizer</a> - though it's not in 3D, it displays the tones more precisely.
		</p>
		<p class="small">
		Yeah, I'm not playing that accurate - but it's about the LED cube, not my piano skills! ;)
