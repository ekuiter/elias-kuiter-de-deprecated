    A few months ago, I discovered the <a href="http://arduino.cc" target="_blank">Arduino platform</a>:
	In short, it's a prototyping board with a microcontroller with that you can develop electronic circuits easily and fast -
	even if you're new to programming.<br />
    This may be a little abstract - so let me give some examples. With an Arduino board you can  ...
    </p>
    <ul>
	  <li>read in sensor data like temperature, acceleration, angle, compass, microphone, ultrasonic sound, and many, many more</li>
	  <li>then process these values and use them for controlling an output device like simple LEDs, motors, speakers, LCD display etc.</li>
	  <li>use more advanced technology like Ethernet, WLAN, GSM, Bluetooth, ... to transmit information over the Internet</li>
	  <li>be creative and combine the above as you like to create something completely new</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Let's begin with the core of any Arduino board - the microcontroller.
    </p>
    <h5>What is a microcontroller?</h5>
	<p>
    A microcontroller (also called µC or uC) is a 'little' version of current computer processors: It executes a program that e.g. controls
	electronic devices or polls sensors. In contrast to a CPU, a µC has an additional RAM chip for temporary data, a flash memory that contains
	a program and other peripherals. For example, the µC of the Arduino Leonardo (which I use at the moment) has an own USB chip that can 
	communicate directly with the computer.
    </p>
    <h5>The first sketch - Hello <del>World</del> Blink</h5>
	<p>
    For uploading a program to a µC there are expensive devices called <em>programmers</em>. Luckily Arduino goes another way: 
	Just connect your board with a micro USB cable to your computer. Every Samsung user should have such a cable =)
    For programming, there's a software called - who would have thought - <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">Arduino</a>.
	In Arduino you write <em>sketches</em>, not programs, which can then be uploaded to your board. The programming language is <em>Wiring</em>,
	a framework for C++, which is predestined for low-level programming. Additionally <em>Wiring</em> hides many details of the underlying hardware.
	A simple first sketch could look like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">int ledPin = 13;             
	
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);    // set LED as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turn on LED
  delay(1000);                // wait one second (1000ms)
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // turn off LED
  delay(1000);                // wait one second
}</pre>
    <p>
    So, let's analyze this piece of code. If uploaded, an LED connected to pin 13 will start to blink every second.
	(<em>Pins </em>are where you connect input or output devices to the Arduino board. They are numbered, so pin 13 shouldn't be that hard to find.)
    Every Arduino sketch must have the two functions <em>setup()</em> and <em>loop()</em>. As the board is turned on, the µC will execute 
	<em>setup()</em> once, so <em>setup()</em> is ideal for initializing operations. In this case the pin with the LED is declared as an output
	(so you can switch the LED on and off later). After <em>setup()</em> is completed, <em>loop()</em> is called and repeated endlessly,
	until the board is turned off or resetted. The code itself is simple: Turn on LED, wait, turn off, wait, and repeat. Over and over.
    </p>
	<p>
    Of course there are far more possibilities than some blinking LEDs. You can see some of those possibilities in my <a href="/electronics/info/en">Electronics</a> section.
